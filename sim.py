"""
Simulation Engine Module

This module will define:
- Baseline scheduler operating over FactoryConfig
- Scenario application (apply_scenario function)
- simulate(factory, spec) pipeline for running deterministic scheduling

Implements the Earliest Due Date (EDD) scheduling heuristic with greedy machine
allocation to produce SimulationResult objects with job timelines and machine allocations.

For now: no functions implemented, placeholder only.
